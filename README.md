A Guitar Hero inspired game for use with the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset

## Overview

This project was made for my "Programming Projects" class in my Junior year of High School. I did a little base work before the class officially began, but far over 90% of the work was done during that semester for the class.

The experience seeks to recreate a Guitar Hero like game with Virtual Reality. It uses an Oculus Rift headset, along with whatever input device you would like to use as the guitar. I set it up to simply take keyboard input as the note presses, and then I mapped a PS2 Guitar Hero controller to simulate those key presses. You could also just straight up use the keyboard, or map an xbox controller to the notes, or whatever you want really.

The game features only a couple of songs, since while I did automate the vast majority of getting the notes, there were always slight tweaks to be made with each song. The point of the project was not to provide as robust of a song choice as a real Guitar Hero game, but instead to provide a unique recreation through the lens of Virtual Reality. So I decided not to spend too much time on gathering more songs.

The main point of this project is obviously the Virtual Reality integration: you will need an Oculus Rift in order to play. It should work natively with the Oculus SDK - make sure you allow outside applications.

## Creation

This project was created using the Unity 3D engine alongside the tools provided by Oculus to work with their headset. All of the script files were written in C#, using the  Microsoft Visual Studio that is standard to use with Unity development. It has only been run on Windows machines, I believe specifically only Windows 10 machines.

## Video Overview / Sample

For the sake of presenting the project, I made this video going over the basics of its creation:
